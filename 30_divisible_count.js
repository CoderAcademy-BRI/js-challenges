/*Count the divisible numbers
Problem Description: Write function divisibleCount(x, y, z) that takes in 3 numbers x, y and z, and returns the number
of integers within the range [x..y] that are divisible by z i.e.: 
For example:
x = 6, y = 11 and z = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the 
range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.*/
