// Good morning ladies and gents, do we have a treat for you today.
// For our bonus round morning challenge, I present to you, Conway's Game of Life!
// The rules are simple. You are presented with 2d array, containing 1's and 0's.
// 1's represent live cells, 0's represent dead cells.
// Your task is to find what the next generation of the 2d array looks like based on the following rules:
//     If a living cell has fewer than 2 neighbours, it dies.
//     If a living cell has 2 or 3 neighbours, it continues to live.
//     If a living cell has greater than 3 neighbours, it dies.
//     If a dead cell has exactly 3 neighbours, it comes to life.
// Good luck and have fun!
