# Asynchronous JavaScript CodeChallenge
We have two files index.html and script.js. Index.html contains a paragraph with a quote and a button. This file shouldn't be modified.

Script.js already contains an array of quotes and the header of two functions. 
The main goal of this challenge is to display quotes randomly every time the button is clicked or after 10 seconds (it doesn't matter if the button is not clicked, every 10 seconds a new quote will be displayed). We can help ourselves with the asynchronous function setInterval.
